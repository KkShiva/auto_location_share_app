# 📍 Auto Share Location

A simple **Flutter app** that automatically shares your current GPS location.  
The app uses **Geolocator** for GPS, **Permission Handler** for location permissions, and **Share Plus** to send your location via the system share sheet (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS, or any other app).  

It also includes a single **green "RE-SHARE" button** styled like WhatsApp to quickly share your location again.
